#include <stdio.h>
 
main()
{
   int value = 1;
 
   while(value<=3)
   {
      printf("Value is %d\n", value);
      value++;

Output:
Value is 1
Value is 2
Value is 3 















programming tutorial
C Programming is an ANSI/ISO standard and powerful programming language for developing real time applications. C programming language was invented by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. It was invented for implementing UNIX operating system. C is most widely used programming language even today. All other programming languages were derived directly or indirectly from C programming concepts. This tutorial explains all basic concepts in C like history of C language, data types, keywords, constants, variables, operators, expressions, control statements, array, pointer, string, library functions, structures and unions etc.

This C programming tutorial is designed for the new learners, students and also for the corporate level developers who want to learn and refresh their C programming skills.

C PROGRAMMING HISTORY:

The C language is a structure oriented programming language, was developed at Bell Laboratories in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie. C language features were derived from an earlier language called “B” (Basic Combined Programming Language – BCPL). C language was invented for implementing UNIX operating system….more…

C PROGRAMMING BASICS:

Steps to be followed for any C program to create and get the output are explained . This is common to all C programs and there is no exception, whether its a very small C program or very large program. Structure of a C program is defined by a set of rules called protocol, to be followed by programmer while writing a C program…more…

C – PRINTF AND SCANF:

printf() and scanf() functions are inbuilt library functions in C which are available in the C library by default. These functions are declared and related macros are defined in “stdio.h” which is a header file. We have to include “stdio.h” file as shown in below C program to make use of these printf() and scanf() library functions….more…
